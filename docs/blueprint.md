## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL was inspired by the idea of connection and communication. A desaturated orange (#E99B57) offers a warm, inviting feel, but is far from overpowering.
- Background color: A very light orange-ish gray (#F5F3F0) provides a neutral, soft backdrop that's easy on the eyes and allows content to stand out. This contributes to the professional but not corporate tone.
- Accent color: A subdued red (#A6523F) will serve as a color that contrasts against the others, ideal for highlighting CTAs or other interactive elements.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for both headlines and body text.
- Use clear, professional icons to represent skill categories and functionalities.
- Maintain a clean, grid-based layout to organize skill listings and user profiles effectively.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement, particularly in login, signup, and search functionalities.
